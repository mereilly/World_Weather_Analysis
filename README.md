## Background and Purpose



After working on the PlanMyTrip app, which our supervisor and Beta testers loved, we took up the project to update/improve the app. We would add : (1) weather descriptions, (2) a customizable filter for the data based on input statements for weather preferences by users, and an output producing (a) potential travel destinations and (b) nearby hotels, and (c) a travel itenarary generated for four citiees with associated mapped routes established through use of the Google Maps Directions API.

You can see the visualizations and the google maps add-in directions in the following:
